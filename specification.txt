Spaceship Game

Objective is to move a spaceship object around a two-dimensional map, from a defined starting point to a defined destination.
Starting point will be bottom-left of map. Destination will be top-right of map.

Game is turn-based, where user moves the spaceship, then other objects move (if able).

Space will be filled with the following objects:

- a number of planets (random number, randomly seeded based on map size)
	- planets are stationary
	- able to refuel spaceships
	- planet destroyed if resources depleted

- a number of meteors (random number, randomly seeded based on map size)
	- meteors will have a random size
	- meteor size determines spaceship damage
	- meteors will damage spaceships if the two objects meet in the same location
	- meteors destroyed if they hit spaceships
	- meteor movement random (to simplify coding)

- 1 player spaceship
	- player can choose between a gunship type or racer type spaceship
	- gunship will be able to attack and destroy meteors
	- gunship able to move one square per turn (one fuel cost)
	- racer able to move two squares per turn (one fuel cost)
	- movement uses fuel
	- gunship attacks use fuel (one fuel cost per attack)
	- meteor hit reduces spaceship hull health	
	- spaceships can refuel at planets
